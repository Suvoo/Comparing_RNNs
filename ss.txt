input shape : (10, 6, 5)
target shape: (10, 2, 3)
masks shape : (10, 6, 3)

This is what we were working with yesterday. As we discussed,the line
pred_y = jax.vmap(model)(x)

should have returned the vector of (10,6,3). Then after applying the mask it would result in the output being (10,2,3).

But my pred_y is giving the output of (10,3). Is this a model error?
